## This project was built during React JS course

# E-commerce platform

This e-commerce project has navigation and routing which takes user to different pages. 
Each item has his own add button that puts item into a cart. 
All of the added items are displayed in cart dropdown which takes user to checkout page. 
In checkout user can increase, decrease, delete items from cart or start making a payment.
This project has all the functionality to create new user account or sign in with google account.
User informations are stored in external serwer- firebase, 
so it is possible to create new profile, sign out and sign in without making a new one.


## Tools & technologies I've used

- Redux (selectors, persist, thunk, saga, hooks) 
- Firebase/firestore
- Google sign in authentication
- Local storage
- Stripe payment
- Styled-components
- Responsiveness
- React Lazy
- PWA
- React Enzyme (unit tests)


## My experience

It was the biggest project I have built so far. Few weeks of constant learning about different technologies, frameworks and features
that are connected to React JS gave me a lot of experience with this library. Although project contains things that I have mentioned before I have also became familiarised with **GraphQl and Apollo, thunk middleware and Context API**. 
This project has taught me a number of things. 
First, it is very important to organise all of the components in a **clear structure** that allows easy access to every part. 
Second, I have learnt that there is a lot of tools and technologies that I can use in my code to handle for example fetching data from database or manage state, but it **depends on specific example**. All of it has his own pros and cons, in most cases it will be a **tradeoff**.
Third- components should be written in a **simple way**, that allows to **reuse** them in different part of project and **test**.
